        </header>
        <p class="section-sizing">After graduating high school, I spent three years attending the University of North Florida. I was majoring in Construction Management after being Exploratory for my first semester. I enjoyed the major, but I hated the work-life balance that I was heading for. That's what started my interest in changing careers.</p>
        <p class= "section-sizing">Coding was always a backup plan for me as I have always been tech savvy, as well as having a friend who already has success in the field being inspiration. I quickly and thoroughly researched which bootcamps would fit my schedule after my fall semester of my senior year, and ended up at Thinkful.</p>
        <p class="section-sizing">Some of my favorite hobbies to do outside of coding are watching and playing football (Go Steelers), video games, traveling, and other team-oriented sports or activities.</p>
        <p class="section-sizing">If you're looking for the future G.O.A.T. Software Engineer, I'm your guy. I will stop at nothing to achieve my goals. I'm excited to see what the future holds for me and all my future collaborators on our future projects.</p>

<!-- I definitely can do better in the future but this was a good learning experience. Actually doing the trial and error process helped me understand rules more and also forced me to google examples and videos to help. Its like a game almost where trial and error builds and levels you up for success -->
  <!-- Also whoever is grading this, could you please add a note on how to get my UL and OL lists to look better stylistically, its bothering me. Thanks. -->
